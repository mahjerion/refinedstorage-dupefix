As you might know, Refined Storage 2 development is very intensive:

* Refined Storage is being completely rewritten;
* Support for the Fabric modloader is being added;
* Every feature that is re-added is thought out again and changes are being made at every step of the way;
* Next to being a rewrite, Refined Storage 2 also contains a bunch of new features!

*... and while all this work is in progress, Refined Storage 1.x still needs maintenance and regular Minecraft ports!*
